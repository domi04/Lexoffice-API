# Python Wrapper for the Lexoffice Public API
This library is a wrapper around the official public API of Lexoffice.
Currently only the upload of invoices is supported as I need this for an automation but maybe I will add other functionality of the API.
If you're interested in that or need other parts of the API, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request
